Name: Write File
Description: >-
  This action first reads the structure of a given directory and then utilizes the 'File Writer' tool to write or append text to a specified file within that directory. It allows checking the directory's contents before performing file operations.
Example: >-
  directory_structure = read_directory('path/to/folder', max_depth=2)
  response = write_file('path/to/folder', 'filename.txt', 'This is the content', mode='a')
Instruction: >-
  First, use the 'Read Directory' tool to examine the directory structure by specifying the directory path and an optional max depth. 
  Then, specify the target folder, the desired filename, and the content for the 'File Writer' tool. Optionally, include a mode ('a' for append and 'w' for overwrite) to determine how the file should be handled.
