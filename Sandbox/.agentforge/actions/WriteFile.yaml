Name: Write File
Description: |-
  The 'Write File' action combines directory examination and file writing operations. 
  It first reads the structure of a specified directory using the 'Read Directory' tool. 
  Then, it utilizes the 'File Writer' tool to write or append text to a specified file within that directory. 
  This action ensures you can check the directory's contents before performing file operations.
Example: |-
  # Example usage of the Write File action:
  directory_structure = read_directory('path/to/folder', max_depth=2)
  print(directory_structure)
  
  selected_file = 'path/to/folder/filename.txt'
  response = write_file(selected_file, 'This is the content', mode='a')
  print(response)
Instruction: |-
  To perform the 'Write File' action, follow these steps:
  1. Use the 'Read Directory' tool to examine the directory structure:
     - Call the `read_directory` function with the directory path and an optional `max_depth` parameter.
     - The function returns a string representing the directory structure.
  2. Review the directory structure output to identify the target directory or file where you want to write or append content.
  3. Select the target path from the directory structure.
  4. Use the 'File Writer' tool to write or append text to the selected file:
     - Call the `write_file` function with the selected file path, content, and an optional `mode` parameter ('a' for append, 'w' for overwrite).
     - The function performs the file operation and returns a response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
  5. Utilize the responses from both tools as needed for your application.
