Name: Image to Text
Args:
  - image_path (str)
Command: imagetotxt
Description: |-
  The Image to Text tool extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
  Key features:
  - Uses OpenCV for image loading and preprocessing
  - Employs Tesseract OCR for text extraction
  - Supports various image formats
  - Converts image to grayscale for improved OCR accuracy
  Limitations:
  - Requires OpenCV (cv2) and pytesseract libraries to be installed
  - OCR accuracy depends on image quality and text clarity
  - May struggle with handwritten or stylized text
Example: |-
  # Example usage of the Image to Text tool:
  from agentforge.tools.ImageToTxt import imagetotxt

  # Example with an image file
  image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
  result = imagetotxt(image_path)
  print("Extracted text:")
  print(result)
Instruction: |-
  To use the Image to Text tool, follow these steps:
  1. Import the imagetotxt function from agentforge.tools.ImageToTxt
  2. Call the imagetotxt function with the required argument:
     - image_path: A string representing the file path to the image
  3. The function will return the extracted text as a string
  4. Process or display the returned text as needed
  5. Ensure that OpenCV (cv2) and pytesseract libraries are installed in your environment
  6. Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may be raised during the process
  7. For best results, use clear, high-resolution images with well-defined text
