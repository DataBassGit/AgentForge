Name: Read Directory
Args:
  - directory_paths (str or list of str)
  - max_depth (int)
Command: read_directory
Description: |-
  The 'Read Directory' tool generates and prints the structure of a directory or multiple directories in a tree-like format. 
  It visually represents folders and files, and you can specify the depth of the structure to be printed. 
  The tool can handle both a single directory path or a list of directory paths. 
  If a specified path does not exist, the tool will create it. 
  Additionally, it indicates if a directory is empty or if there are more files beyond the specified depth.
Example: |-
  # Example usage of the Read Directory tool for a single directory
  directory_path = '/path/to/directory'
  max_depth = 3
  directory_structure = read_directory(directory_path, max_depth)
  print(directory_structure)

  # Example usage for multiple directories
  directory_paths = ['/path/to/directory1', '/path/to/directory2']
  max_depth = 2
  directory_structure = read_directory(directory_paths, max_depth)
  print(directory_structure)

  1. Call the `read_directory` function with the following arguments:
     - `directory_paths`: A string representing a single directory path, or a list of strings representing multiple directory paths.
     - `max_depth` (optional): An integer specifying the maximum depth of the directory structure to display. If not provided, the entire directory structure will be displayed.
  2. The function will return a string representing the directory structure in a tree-like format.
