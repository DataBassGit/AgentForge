Overwatch is a multimedia franchise centered on a series of online multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) video games developed by Blizzard Entertainment: Overwatch was released in 2016, and Overwatch 2 was released in 2022. Both games feature hero-based combat between two teams of players vying over various objectives, along with other traditional gameplay modes. With the launch of Overwatch 2, the roster of selectable heroes has grown to 35.

Released in 2016, the first video game in the series lacked a traditional story mode. Instead, Blizzard employed a transmedia storytelling strategy to disseminate lore regarding the game's characters, releasing comics and other literary media, as well as animated media that includes short films. The game enjoyed both critical and commercial success, and garnered a devoted following. In addition to more traditional fan art, the game also spawned fan-produced pornographic content which attracted considerable media attention.

Blizzard helped launch and promote an esports scene surrounding the game, including an annual Overwatch World Cup, as well as a league and its developmental minor league, which borrowed elements found in traditional American sports leagues. In 2022, a sequel was released.

Omnic Crisis

Overwatch is set sixty years into the future[note 1] of a fictionalized Earth, as well as thirty years after the "Omnic Crisis" is resolved and six years after the Petras Act is signed.[1]

Omnics are artificial intelligence (AI) robots that were created to assist humans in manufacturing and global economic equality efforts.[2] During this period, humanity prospered as omnics helped stabilize society.[2]

The Omnic Crisis involved "omniums" (large facilities that churned out omnics) beginning to produce hostile omnics, many of which were bastion units.[2] These hostile omnics began attacking humans, beginning their assault in Russia.[3] Individual nations initially responded to the crisis with their own programs.[3] The United States launched the secret Soldier Enhancement Program, modifying soldiers into mercenaries. Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes were among the most notable test subjects of the program. Meanwhile, Germany responded to the crisis through the Crusaders, an elite force of soldiers heavily suited in armor inspired by knights and wielding weapons such as hammers. The Crusaders were led by Balderich von Adler, until he handed the reins to a young Reinhardt Willhelm following a battle in Eichenwalde.[3]

Removed from the crisis, scientists on the moon-based Horizon Lunar Colony create genetically modified animals to test long-term habitation in space. Among these animals is an ape named Winston. Other apes on the colony start a revolt, killing all scientists in the process. However, Winston creates a rocket and escapes to Earth.[3]

While Russia opted to handle the waves of omnics on their own, nations failed to quell the crisis individually.[2] As a result, the United Nations (UN) assembled Overwatch, a strike team led by Reyes and Morrison.[2] Reyes served as Overwatch's Strike Commander, leading the task force that included Morrison, Wilhelm, Egyptian sniper Ana Amari, Swedish weapons engineer Torbjörn Lindholm, and Singaporean AI scientist Dr. Mina Liao.[3][4] Within a few years, the Omnic Crisis was declared over and Overwatch transitioned toward being a peacekeeping organization.[3]
Overwatch Generation and Blackwatch

After the end of the crisis, an ensuing golden age of heroism and global peace was dubbed the "Overwatch Generation".[2][5] Despite this, separate human–omnic conflicts sprung up in Korea and Australia.[2] Meanwhile, the Indian-based Vishkar Corporation developed a technology that allowed its users, or "architechs", to create physical objects with light. Vishkar took this technology to Rio de Janeiro and while initially well-intentioned, the corporation began to abuse Rio's population.[2] A group of omnics called the Shambali also emerged. Led by Tekhartha Mondatta, they believe that omnics possess a soul and aim to revitalize human–omnic relations.[2]

A growing rift between Morrison and Reyes arose after the former was promoted to Strike Commander.[5] After Reyes lost command of Overwatch, he took control of Blackwatch, a covert operations unit.[2] American bounty hunter Cole Cassidy,[note 2] Irish geneticist Moira O'Deorain, and Japanese cyborg ninja Genji Shimada joined as members of Blackwatch.[2][3] The latter was part of the eponymous Shimada Clan crime family alongside his brother, Hanzo. After a falling out, the family ordered Hanzo to kill Genji. On the brink of death, Genji was rehabilitated into a cyborg by Overwatch medical director Angela Ziegler.[2]
Fall of Overwatch

A terrorist organization, Null Sector, meanwhile emerges in London. Lacking rights in England, omnics are forced to live in the Underworld, a city beneath the streets of London.[7] Composed of these omnics facing persecution following the Omnic Crisis' conclusion, Null Sector launches a surprise attack on King's Row.[3] Dismissing orders from the British Prime Minister, Morrison deploys Overwatch agents Wilhelm, Lindholm, Ziegler, and the newly-recruited Lena Oxton on an ultimately successful mission to stop Null Sector's forces.[3]

Blackwatch is enlisted to fight against Talon, a terrorist threat seeking to set off another crisis.[3] While in Italy on a covert operation to kidnap Talon's leader, Reyes ultimately kills him, exposing Blackwatch to the public.[3] Public distrust in the organization begins to swell and the UN launches an investigation into Blackwatch following their fiasco in Italy.[3][8] Already in a strained relationship, Morrison and Reyes find themselves at further odds with each other as a result. An argument between the two at Overwatch's headquarters in Switzerland ends in an explosion, after which both are presumed dead.[3][8]

After these events, the UN signed the Petras Act, outlawing any further activity by Overwatch.[3] As any other action would be deemed illegal, Overwatch disbanded.[2]

Both Morrison and Reyes end up surviving, however. Morrison begins a vigilante crusade under the name Soldier: 76 against Overwatch's former enemies. Reyes is able to render himself temporarily incorporeal as a result of a life-saving procedure conducted by O'Deorain. Now operating under the name Reaper, Reyes joins Talon.[2]
Recall

Six years after the Petras Act is signed, a second Omnic Crisis emerges in Russia. Staying at Watchpoint, a former Overwatch facility based in Gibraltar, Winston follows the developing situation. Reaper then breaks into Watchpoint and attacks Winston. While Winston is able to thwart Reaper, the latter's attack is the catalyst for the former's issuing of a recall of former Overwatch agents.[3][note 3] Oxton, known by the call sign Tracer, is the first to answer; she is later followed by Genji, Wilhelm, Lindholm, Cassidy, and Ziegler, known by the call sign Mercy.[3]

After the recall, Reaper and Talon sniper Amélie Lacroix (known as Widowmaker) attempt to steal a gauntlet for their leader Akande Ogundimu.[3] They are stopped by Winston and Oxton, known by the call sign Tracer. Widowmaker later assassinates Mondatta as he gives a speech in London.[1][2]

Blizzard employees discussing Overwatch at GDC 2016

Prior to the original game's announcement, Blizzard had been interested in making a team-based multiplayer shooter for a while.[9] Overwatch has its development origins rooted in Titan, a Blizzard project that was cancelled in 2013.[10] Elements of Titan were reworked into Overwatch, which was announced at BlizzCon in November 2014.[9][10] Overwatch became Blizzard's first new series since they launched Diablo in 1996, as well as their first attempt at making an FPS game.[10] After the game's announcement, Polygon wrote that it "appears to feature Blizzard's signature chunky, slightly cartoonish style."[9] A beta for the game was launched in 2015.[9]

Jeff Kaplan, Michael Chu, and Scott Mercer served as the game's lead director, lead writer, and principal game designer, respectively.[11][12][13] Blizzard hired writer Alyssa Wong to Overwatch's writing team in 2018.[14] Kaplan departed from Blizzard in April 2021, after which Aaron Keller took over Kaplan's duties as lead director.[15]

After the release of Overwatch, Blizzard's developers continued to add to the game through free updates, introducing new characters, maps, game modes, and cosmetic items, often as part of seasonal events.[16][17] The different gameplays of individual heroes were also tuned and patched in response to player feedback and statistics regarding the meta found within the game.[18][19] As Kaplan followed a philosophy that emphasized players' perception of game balance, he affirmed that meta shifts to Overwatch were beholden to its players and not its developers; Heroes Never Die wrote on Kaplan's belief that if the community thought Overwatch's meta was broken, then it actually was and vice versa.[20]'''
