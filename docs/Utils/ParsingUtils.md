## Parsing YAML Strings

`AgentUtils` also specializes in parsing YAML-formatted strings into Python dictionaries, a process integral to interpreting agent configurations or dynamic content.

### Example Usage:

```python
yaml_content = parse_yaml_string(agent_utils.logger, yaml_block)
```

### Parsing Process:

- The `parse_yaml_string` method accepts a YAML string and converts it into a structured Python dictionary. This functionality is essential for agents that need to interpret or utilize configuration data and settings expressed in YAML within their operational context.

## Extracting YAML Blocks

Additionally, the class can extract YAML content from larger text blocks, a feature useful when dealing with documents or data where YAML is embedded within other formats.

### Example Usage:

```python
extracted_yaml = extract_yaml_block(AgentUtils.logger, yaml_string)
```

### Extraction Process:

- Utilizes a regular expression to identify and isolate YAML blocks within a given text, enabling the extraction of pure YAML content for further parsing or processing.
