# Configuration Overview

## Getting Started with Configurations

Welcome to the central hub for system configurations. Below, you'll find specific areas of interest that dictate how the system behaves. Each section has dedicated documentation to provide in-depth insights.

### **Foundation:**

- **[Config Class](ConfigClass.md)**: The heart of configurations. Understand the class responsible for harmonizing the system's settings.

- **[Settings](../Settings/Settings.md)**: A deep dive into directives, memories, models, paths, and storage. Think of these as the fine-tuned engine settings that keep the system humming.

### **Advanced Customizations:**

- **[Agent Prompts](../Agents/AgentPrompts.md)**: Craft dynamic prompts to guide agent actions. 

- **[Custom Agents](../Agents/CustomAgents.md)**: Empower your system with tailor-made agents fitting specific needs.

- **[Personas](../Personas/Personas.md)**: Add flair to the system's interactions. Make it more human-like and relatable. (Note: Feature in development)

- **[Tools & Actions](../Tools/ToolsActions.md)**: The system's utility belt. Understand the tools available and how they can be choreographed into actionable sequences.

- **[Overriding LLM Defaults](../Agents/Overrides/Overriding.md)**: Learn the flexibility of having agents override default LLM settings when needed.
