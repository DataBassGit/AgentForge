Here is a suggested approach for developing a web scraper:

1. Choose a website to scrape. For this example, let's scrape product information from an ecommerce site like Amazon.

2. Review the website and determine what information you want to extract. For Amazon, this could be product titles, images, prices, ratings, etc.

3. Inspect the page source to find the HTML elements containing the target information. For example, product titles may be in <h1> tags, images in <img> tags, prices in <span> tags with a "price" class, etc. 

4. Choose a scraping library like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium. For this example, we'll use BeautifulSoup.

5. Write a Python script to scrape the page. It would look something like this:

```python
import requests 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptops"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

titles = soup.find_all("h1")
images = soup.find_all("img", {"class": "s-image"}) 
prices = soup.find_all("span", {"class": "price"})

for title, image, price in zip(titles, images, prices):
    print(title.text)
    print(image["src"])
    print(price.text)
```

6. Run the script and verify it is extracting the correct information.

7. Modify the script to scrape multiple pages or product listings. You can pass a page number query parameter to get subsequent pages.

8. Store the scraped data in a CSV file or database for later use.

    def __init__(self, ml_model, web_crawler):
        self.ml_model = ml_model
        self.web_crawler = web_crawler
        
    def search(self, query):
        # Use the ML model to analyze the query and determine relevant websites
        relevant_websites = self.ml_model.predict(query)
        
        # Crawl the relevant websites to extract information
        search_results = []
        for website in relevant_websites:
            search_results.extend(self.web_crawler.crawl(website))
            
        # Rank the search results by relevance using the ML model

Therefore, the task of implementing a search algorithm appears to have been completed.

2023-07-15 19:59:48 - TASK RESULT:
Here is a suggested database schema for storing scraped search data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE websites (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    content TEXT 
);

CREATE TABLE search_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    website_id INTEGER REFERENCES websites(id),
    title TEXT,
    snippet TEXT,
    rank INTEGER 
);

CREATE TABLE queries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL 
);

CREATE TABLE query_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query_id INTEGER REFERENCES queries(id),
    result_id INTEGER REFERENCES search_results(id),
    rank INTEGER 
);
```

This schema contains:

- A `websites` table to store information scraped from websites 
- A `search_results` table to store individual search results (title, snippet, rank)
- A `queries` table to store search queries 
- A `query_results` table to map search queries to their results, along with a rank

The `websites` and `search_results` tables would be populated by the web crawler. The `queries` and `query_results` tables would be populated by the search algorithm.

This database schema separates the data into logical tables for websites, search results, queries, and query-result mappings. The schema uses foreign keys to link related data across tables. The `rank` columns allow search results and query results to be ordered by relevance.

This database could be implemented using PostgreSQL, as suggested in the architecture. The Flask API could execute queries against this database to retrieve search results for queries. Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improving the database schema.

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    query = request.args.get('query')
    # Forward query to API and get results
    results = search_engine.search(query) 
    return render_template('results.html', results=results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True) 
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
