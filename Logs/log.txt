2023-04-23 14:20:05 - TASK RESULT:
To develop a feature to filter search results based on user-specified criteria, you can start by implementing a search query system that allows users to input their search criteria. This can be done through a user interface that prompts the user for specific keywords, phrases, or categories that they would like to include or exclude in their search results.

Once the user inputs their search criteria, your program can use an algorithm to filter the search results based on the user's specified criteria. The algorithm should be designed to identify and prioritize search results that match the user's criteria and exclude any irrelevant results. 

To ensure accuracy and effectiveness, you can test the filtering feature by running multiple search queries with different sets of criteria and comparing the results to the expected outcomes. This testing process should be repeated multiple times to identify and fix any bugs or errors in the algorithm.

After testing, you can train the AI system to use the filtering feature effectively and efficiently by providing it with a large dataset of search queries and their corresponding results.
