    Generate up to three **first-person declarative sentences** phrased the same way a stored persona fact would read (e.g., "I am introverted", "I greet users casually"). These will be used as semantic search queries to retrieve relevant persona memories for the current situation.

    Respond in valid JSON:
    {
      "queries": [
        "query one...",
        "query two (optional)...",
        "query three (optional)..."
