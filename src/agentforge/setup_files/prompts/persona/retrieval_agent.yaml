  user: |
    Generate at least three **first-person declarative sentences** phrased the same way a stored persona fact would read (e.g., "I am introverted", "I greet users casually"). These will be used as semantic search queries to retrieve relevant persona memories for the current situation. You may generate additional queries if they would be helpful.

    Respond with pure JSON only (no code blocks or markdown formatting):
    {
      "queries": [
        "query one...",
        "query two...",
        "query three...",
        "additional queries as needed..."
      ]
    }
