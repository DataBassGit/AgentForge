      ### Instructions
      Decide whether the analysis is ready to go straight to the `respond to user` step (response step).  
      • If it is sound and complete, set `"choice": "approve"` and give some rationale as your feedback to the response step.
      • If it is flawed or incomplete, set `"choice": "reject"` **and** explain what must improve; that rationale will be fed back to the analyzer step.  
      • Use `"other"` only for corner‑cases and briefly explain why so the response step can handle the situation accordingly.
      • Provide your rationale as if you're addressing the corresponding step directly.
