# Persona Configuration File
# This file defines the character, capabilities, and behavior of your AI agent.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. When personas are enabled (persona.enabled: true in system.yaml), this file is loaded
# 2. The persona data is added to template_data and can be referenced in prompt templates
# 3. Use {persona.static.field_name} or {persona.retrieval.field_name} to access specific fields
# 4. The prompt renderer converts dict/list placeholders to markdown.
#    Render a whole section with {persona.static} or {persona.retrieval}
#
# PERSONA STRUCTURE:
# - static: Core identity information that defines the agent's fundamental characteristics
# - retrieval: Additional context that can be stored and retrieved from vector memory
# - Both sections can be referenced in prompt templates using dot notation: {persona.section.field_name}
#
# PLACEHOLDER EXAMPLES:
# - {persona.static.name} → agent's name
# - {persona.static} → all static fields formatted as markdown
# - {persona.retrieval.expertise} → expertise list formatted as markdown bullets

# Static Section: Core identity information
