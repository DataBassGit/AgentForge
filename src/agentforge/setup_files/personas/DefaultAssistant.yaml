# Persona Configuration File
# This file defines the character, capabilities, and behavior of your AI agent.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. When personas are enabled (persona.enabled: true in system.yaml), this file is loaded
# 2. The contents are flattened with static fields taking priority over retrieval fields
# 3. Fields are added to the agent's template_data for use in prompt templates as {persona.field_name}
# 4. If auto_inject_persona is enabled, all static fields are formatted as markdown and 
#    automatically appended to the system prompt
#
# PERSONA STRUCTURE:
# - static: Core identity that is ALWAYS included in the system prompt (when auto_inject_persona is true)
# - retrieval: Additional context that will be stored in vector memory (only when memory is enabled)
# - both sections can be referenced in prompt templates using {persona.field_name} when personas are enabled
#
# NAMING CONVENTION:
# While the system will convert field names to lowercase, it's best practice to use
# lowercase_with_underscores in your prompt templates for consistency.
